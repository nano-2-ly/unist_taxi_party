## Vision
UNIST transportation infra is really bad.😢 (What is UNIST? <a href = "https://www.unist.ac.kr/">click here</a>)<br>
Bad infra makes people go labs or companies located in other cities. And it makes students less creative.<br>
To go outside of UNIST, we have to wait bus for 30min. And take the bus for 10~20 min to go the nearest village(ex 구영리).<br>
<br>
To solve this problem. We decide to take a taxi.🚕 It's expensive but fast. When we take the taxi with 4 people, It can be also cheap because we split the bill.<br>
**TAXIPART** app will find your carpool easily,Then we can go everywhere fast and cheaply.😎😎😎<br>
